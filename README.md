# Console-Finances

## Description

The repo uses javascript to analyze the financial data of a company. 
The dataset consists of two fields, data and profits/losses.
The code finds out;

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
  * You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  * (`Total/Number of months`)

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

Kindly open the console to see the final outcome of the analyses.
